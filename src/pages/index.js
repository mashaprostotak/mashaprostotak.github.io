              I am a Computer Science MSc student at ETH Zurich, researching how to enhance personalization, social adaptability, fairness, and pedagogical effectiveness of LLMs in Education.
              I currently collaborate with the <a href="https://lre.inf.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Language, Reasoning and Education</a> group at ETH, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tpp9ZjoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Mrinmaya Sachan</a>, <a href="https://donya-rooein.github.io/" target="_blank">Donya Rooein</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pGNS3t8AAAAJ&hl&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Sankalan Pal Chowdhury</a>.
              Previously, I worked on a pedagogical chatbot to provide support to students in a graduate-level course at <a href="https://sustec.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Group for Sustainability and Technology</a>, supervised by <a href="https://sustec.ethz.ch/people/alumni/phd-students-and-scientific-assistants/dr--malte-toetzke.html" target="_blank">Malte Toetzke</a>. I also collaborated with <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi/Home.html" target="_blank">Professor Nisheeth K. Vishnoi</a> at Yale University. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Driven by the belief that the expanding role of LLMs in everyday life demands a deeper understanding of their social awareness and moral reasoning, my research interests are focused on <strong>social intelligence, fairness, and moral judgment of LLMs in high-stakes social contexts</strong>. 
              I am interested both in analyzing and improving these capabilities of existing models, as well as in developing LLM-based frameworks that support humans in such domains.
              <br/><br/>
              The other half of my personality is passionate about <strong>building AI-powered products</strong> that change the way people engage with the world and help them accomplish more and with greater efficiency and impact. My dream is to find a significant problem that I deeply care about and build a startup with like-minded people to solve it.
